xhrfiles
========

xhrfiles is my take on Andrew Valums' file-uploader (an amazing
use of modern technology, in my opinion) as a jQuery plugin. The
reason I chose to rewrite it as a jQuery plugin is to reduce the
duplication of code when you already have jQuery as a dependency.
I did not write this as a replacement, if you don't have the need
for jQuery, use file-uploader.
